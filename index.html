        <h1>Harpes Gaming</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <em>Harpe Gaming</em>. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>* Unplug</li>
                <li>* Interact</li>
                <li>* Reconnect</li>
            </ul>
                
                <p>And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
                that bring people together through shared experiences. With 
                all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
                that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
                intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
                a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>
                
                <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
                heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
                hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
                simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
                If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
                probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p>
                
                <p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
                gaming and the company of good friends. 
                Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
                a game from our demo library and start playing. 
                We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
                social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>
                
                <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
                publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
                our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both 
                new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
